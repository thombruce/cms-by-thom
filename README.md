# Helvellyn

A Ruby on Rails based content management system that exposes a customisable API for publishing content.

## Dependencies

- Ruby
- Ruby on Rails
- Vue.js
- Vuex
- Vuetify
- Webpack

## TODO:

* Update this README with useful information
* Maybe create mountable 'helvellyn' engine for open source shareability, and move application to 'helvellyn-cms' (note: just the CMS-y bits - authentication/authorisation should be left to the consuming app, or an additional plugin)
