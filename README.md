## Development

Helvellyn devlopment uses [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), which is a very minimalist approach to Git flow. The master branch is always production-code, ready to deploy. Code that is in development is reviewed in isolation on its own feature branch and its related pull request before being merged to master.
